            Nodes 1 and 2 are the nodes between which the switch terminals are
            connected.  The model name is mandatory while the initial conditions are
            optional.  For the voltage controlled switch, nodes 3 and 4 are the
            positive and negative controlling nodes respectively.  For the current
            controlled switch, the controlling current is that through the specified
            voltage source.  The direction of positive controlling current flow is
            from the positive node, through the source, to the negative node.

            The switch model allows an almost ideal switch to be described in NGSPICE.
            The switch is not quite ideal, in that the resistance can not change
            from 0 to infinity, but must always have a finite positive value.  By
            proper selection of the on and off resistances, they can be effectively
            zero and infinity in comparison to other circuit elements.  The
            parameters available are:

            *(See the .OPTIONS control line for a description of GMIN, its default
            value results in an off-resistance of 1.0e+12 ohms.)

            The use of an ideal element that is highly nonlinear such as a switch
            can cause large discontinuities to occur in the circuit node voltages.
            A rapid change such as that associated with a switch changing state can
            cause numerical roundoff or tolerance problems leading to erroneous
            results or timestep difficulties.  The user of switches can improve the
            situation by taking the following steps:
        </p>
        <p>
            First, it is wise to set ideal switch impedances just high or low enough
            to be negligible with respect to other circuit elements.  Using switch
            impedances that are close to "ideal" in all cases aggravates the problem
            of discontinuities mentioned above.  Of course, when modelling real
            devices such as MOSFETS, the on resistance should be adjusted to a
            realistic level depending on the size of the device being modelled.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a wide range of <var>ON</var> to <var>OFF</var> resistance must be used in the switches
            (<var>ROFF</var>/<var>RON</var> >1e+12), then the tolerance on errors allowed during transient
            analysis should be decreased by using the .OPTIONS control line and
            specifying <var>TRTOL</var> to be less than the default value of 7.0.  When
            switches are placed around capacitors, then the option <var>CHGTOL</var> should
            also be reduced.  Suggested values for these two options are 1.0 and
            1e-16 respectively.  These changes inform NGSPICE to be more careful
            around the switch points so that no errors are made due to the rapid
            change in the circuit.
