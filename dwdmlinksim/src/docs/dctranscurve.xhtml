            .DC: DC Transfer Function
            <br/>
	    <br/>
            General form:
        <br/>
        <code>
            .DC SRCNAM VSTART VSTOP VINCR [SRC2 START2 STOP2 INCR2]
        </code>
	<br/>
	<br/>
        Examples:
	<br/>
        <code>.DC VIN 0.25 5.0 0.25</code><br/>
            <code>.DC VDS 0 10 .5 VGS 0 5 1</code><br/>
            <code>.DC VCE 0 10 .25 IB 0 10U 1U</code><br/>
            <code>.DC RLoad 1k 2k 100</code><br/>
            <code>.DC TEMP -15 75 5</code>

            The DC line defines the dc transfer curve source and sweep limits (again
            with capacitors open and inductors shorted). <var>SRCNAM</var> is the name of an
            independent voltage or current source, a resistor or the circuit temperature.
            <var>VSTART</var>, <var>VSTOP</var>, and <var>VINCR</var> are the starting, final, and incrementing values
            respectively.  The first example causes the value of the voltage source <var>VIN</var>
            to be swept from 0.25 Volts to 5.0 Volts in increments of 0.25 Volts.  A
            second source (<var>SRC2</var>) may optionally be specified with associated sweep
            parameters.  In this case, the first source is swept over its range for each
            value of the second source.  This option can be useful for obtaining
            semiconductor device output characteristics.<!--  See the second example circuit
            description in Appendix A.-->
