        <code>.TF OUTVAR INSRC</code>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <code>.TF V(5, 3) VIN</code><br/>
        <code>.TF I(VLOAD) VIN</code>
        <p>
            The TF line defines the small-signal output and input for the dc
            small-signal analysis.  <var>OUTVAR</var> is the small-signal output variable and
            <var>INSRC</var> is the small-signal input source.  If this line is included, NGSPICE
            computes the dc small-signal value of the transfer function
            (output/input), input resistance, and output resistance.  For the first
            example, NGSPICE would compute the ratio of V(5, 3) to VIN, the
            small-signal input resistance at VIN, and the small-signal output
            resistance measured across nodes 5 and 3.
