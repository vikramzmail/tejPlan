            <var>N+</var> and <var>N-</var> are the positive and negative nodes, respectively.
            Current flow is from the positive node, through the source, to the negative
            node.  <var>VNAM</var> is the name of a voltage source through which the
            controlling current flows.  The direction of positive controlling
            current flow is from the positive node, through the source, to the
            negative node of <var>VNAM</var>.  <var>VALUE</var> is the current gain.
