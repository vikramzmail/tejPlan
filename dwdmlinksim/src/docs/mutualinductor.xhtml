            LYYYYYYY and LZZZZZZZ are the names of the two coupled inductors, and
            <var>VALUE</var> is the coefficient of coupling, K, which must be greater than 0
            and less than or equal to 1.  Using the 'dot' convention, place a 'dot'
            on the first node of each inductor.
