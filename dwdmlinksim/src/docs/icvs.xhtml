            <var>N+</var> and <var>N-</var> are the positive and negative nodes, respectively.
            <var>VNAM</var> is the name of a voltage source through which the controlling current
            flows.  The direction of positive controlling current flow is from the positive node, through
            the source, to the negative node of <var>VNAM</var>.  <var>VALUE</var>
            is the transresistance (in ohms).
