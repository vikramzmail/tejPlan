            The dc analysis portion of NGSPICE determines the dc operating point of
            the circuit with inductors shorted and capacitors opened.  The dc
            analysis options are specified on the @code{.DC}, @code{.TF}, and @code{.OP}
            control lines.A dc analysis is automatically performed prior to a transient
            analysis to determine the transient initial conditions, and prior to an ac
            small-signal analysis to determine the linearized, small-signal models
            for nonlinear devices.  If requested, the dc small-signal value of a
            transfer function (ratio of output variable to input source), input
            resistance, and output resistance is also computed as a part of the dc
            solution.  The dc analysis can also be used to generate dc transfer
            curves: a specified independent voltage, current source, resistor or
            temperature is stepped over a user-specified range and the dc output
            variables are stored for each sequential source value.
        </p>

            Temperature (@code{TEMP}) and resistance sweeps have been introduced
            in NGSPICE, they were not available in the original code of Spice3f5.

            The inclusion of this line in an input file directs NGSPICE to determine
            the dc operating point of the circuit with inductors shorted and
            capacitors opened.  Note: a DC analysis is automatically performed prior
            to a transient analysis to determine the transient initial conditions,
            and prior to an AC small-signal<!--, Noise, and Pole-Zero--> analysis to
            determine the linearized, small-signal models for nonlinear devices<!-- (see
            the KEEPOPINFO variable above)-->.
