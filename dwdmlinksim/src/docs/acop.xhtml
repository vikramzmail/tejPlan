            The ac small-signal portion of NGSPICE computes the ac output variables
            as a function of frequency.  The program first computes the dc
            operating point of the circuit and determines linearized, small-signal
            models for all of the nonlinear devices in the circuit.  The resultant
            linear circuit is then analyzed over a user-specified range of
            frequencies.  The desired output of an ac small-signal analysis is
            usually a transfer function (voltage gain, transimpedance, etc).  If
            the circuit has only one ac input, it is convenient to set that input
            to unity and zero phase, so that output variables have the same value
            as the transfer function of the output variable with respect to the
            input.

            <var>DEC</var> stands for decade variation, and <var>ND</var> is the number of points per
            decade.  <var>OCT</var> stands for octave variation, and <var>NO</var> is the number of points
            per octave.  <var>LIN</var> stands for linear variation, and <var>NP</var> is the number of
            points.  <var>FSTART</var> is the starting frequency, and <var>FSTOP</var> is the final
            frequency.  If this line is included in the input file, NGSPICE performs
            an <var>AC</var> analysis of the circuit over the specified frequency range.  Note
            that in order for this analysis to be meaningful, at least one
            independent source must have been specified with an ac value.
