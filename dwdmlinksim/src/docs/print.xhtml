            General form:<br/>
            <br/>
            <code>.PRINT PRTYPE OV1 [OV2 ... OV8]</code><br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Examples:<br/>
            <br/>
            <code>.PRINT TRAN V(4) I(VIN)</code><br/>
            <code>.PRINT DC V(2) I(VSRC) V(23, 17)</code><br/>
            <code>.PRINT AC VM(4, 2) VR(7) VP(8, 3)</code><br/>
        </span>
        <p>
            The Print line defines the contents of a tabular listing of one to eight
            output variables.  <var>PRTYPE</var> is the type of the analysis (DC, AC, TRAN<!--,
            NOISE, or DISTO-->) for which the specified outputs are desired.<!--  The form
            for voltage or current output variables is the same as given in the
            previous section for the print command; Spice2 restricts the output
            variable to the following forms (though this restriction is not enforced
            by Ngspice):-->
        </p>

        V(N1[,N2])
        <p>
            specifies the voltage difference between nodes <var>N1</var> and <var>N2</var>.
            If <var>N2</var> (and the preceding comma) is omitted, ground (0) is assumed.
            <!--See the <a href="save.xhtml">save</a> command in the previous section for more details.-->
            For compatibility with spice2, the following five additional values can be accessed for
            the ac analysis by replacing the "V" in V(N1,N2) with:
        </p>
        <code>VR    -    real part</code><br/>
        <code>VI    -    imaginary part</code><br/>
        <code>VM    -    magnitude</code><br/>
        <code>VP    -    phase</code><br/>
        <code>VDB   -    20  log10(magnitude)</code><br/>
        <br/>
        I(VXXXXXXX)
        <p>
            specifies the current flowing in the independent voltage source named
            VXXXXXXX.  Positive current flows from the positive node, through the
            source, to the negative node.  For the ac analysis, the corresponding
            replacements for the letter I may be made in the same way as described
            for voltage outputs.
        </p>
        <!--p>
            Output variables for the noise and distortion analyses have a different
            general form from that of the other analyses.
        </p-->
        <p>
            There is no limit on the number of .PRINT lines for each type of
            analysis.
