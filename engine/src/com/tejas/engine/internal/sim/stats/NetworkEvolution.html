<h2>Network evolution</h2>

<p>This report shows some metrics characterizing the evolution of the network during the simulation.</p>

<p><b>Important</b>: Average values are computed in a time-averaged fashion, taking into account the period of time in each state.</p>

</center>

<ul>
<li><a name='trafficInfo_numberOfDemands'>Number of demands</a>: Number of demands. This value remains fixed during the simulation</li>
<li><a name='trafficInfo_totalTraffic'>Average total offered traffic</a>: Average offered traffic to the whole network, summing the offered traffic by every demand</li>
<li><a name='trafficInfo_trafficPerNodePair'>Average offered traffic per node pair</a>: Average offered traffic between each pair of nodes. It is equivalent to the ratio between the previous metric and the number of node pairs</li>
<li><a name='trafficInfo_blockedTraffic'>Average blocked traffic</a>: Average percentage of the offered traffic which is blocked</li>
<li><a name='trafficInfo_oversubscribedTraffic'>Average over-subscribed traffic</a>: Average percentage of the carried traffic which is above the capacity of the links. In other words, it is the time-average of the summation of the excess traffic in each link divided by the total carried traffic</li>
</ul>

<li><a name='routingInfo_bottleneckUtilization'>Average bottleneck utilization (w. reserved bw, w.o. reserved bw)</a>: Average utilization of the bottleneck link in the whole network. This metric is computed considering or not the reserved bandwidth by protection segments (if any)</li>
<li><a name='routingInfo_routeLength'>Average route length</a>: Average length of the defined routes. This metric is measured in hops, kilometers and miliseconds</li>
</ul>
