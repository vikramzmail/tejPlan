<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p><b>Important</b>: "Time-averaged" means that the value of the metric is weighted by the period of time in that the network can be found in that state, divided by the total simulation time.</p>
<h4>Network-wide information</h4>
<ul>
<li><a name='network_numConnections'>Max./Min./Avg. number of active connections</a>: It is equal to the maximum, minimum, and average number of active connections at any time. The average value is a time-averaged metric</li>
<li><a name='network_carriedTraffic'>Max./Min./Avg. carried traffic (E)</a>: It is equal to the maximum, minimum, and average carried traffic by active connections. The average value is a time-averaged metric</li>
<li><a name='network_connBlockingProbability'>Avg. connection blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the total number of blocked connections divided by the total number of offered connections, multiplied by 100</li>
<li><a name='network_connWeightedBlockingProbability'>Avg. weighted connection blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the total number of blocked connections multiplied by their requested traffic, divided by the total number of offered connections multiplied by their requested traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
<li><a name='network_trafficBlockingProbability'>Avg. traffic blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the time-averaged value of the per-connection blocked traffic, multiplied by 100. Here, at time <i>t</i>, all active connections (even those blocked, released by algorithms, or degraded, which in an ideal case should be active at 100%) are evaluated. A degraded connection is that whose current carried traffic is below the requested one</li>
<li><a name='network_avgOverSubscribedLinkCapacity'>Avg. over-subscribed link capacity (%)</a>: It is equal to the time-averaged value of the sum of the excess carried traffic (exceding link capacity) per link, divided by the total carried traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
<li><a name='network_avgExcessCarriedTraffic'>Avg. excess carried traffic (%)</a>: It is equal to the time-averaged value of the sum of the excess carried per connection (exceding requested bandwidth), divided by the total carried traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
</ul>

<h4>Per-demand information</h4>

<ul>
    <li><a name='demand_id'>Id</a>: Unique identifier of the demand</li>

    <li><a name='demand_egressNode'>Egress node</a>: Egress node of the demand</li>
    <li><a name='demand_plannedOfferedTraffic'>Planned offered traffic (E)</a>: Offered traffic by this demand in the original design</li>
    <li><a name='demand_avgOfferedTraffic'>Average offered traffic (E)</a>: Average offered traffic by connections of this demand, including blocked connections. It is a time-averaged metric</li>

    <li><a name='demand_connBlockingProbability'>Connection blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the total number of blocked connections divided by the total number of offered connections, multiplied by 100</li>
    <li><a name='demand_connWeightedBlockingProbability'>Connection weighted blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the total number of blocked connections multiplied by their requested traffic, divided by the total number of offered connections multiplied by their requested traffic, multiplied by 100</li>
    <li><a name='demand_trafficBlockingProbability'>Traffic blocking probability (%)</a>: It is equal to the time-averaged value of the per-connection blocked traffic, multiplied by 100. Here, at time <i>t</i>, all active connections (even those blocked, released by algorithms, or degraded, which in an ideal case should be active at 100%) are evaluated.

    <li><a name='link_carriedTraffic'>Max./Min./Avg. carried traffic (E)</a>: It is equal to the maximum, minimum, and average carried traffic by active connections traversing the link. The average value is a time-averaged metric</li>
    <li><a name='link_numConnections'>Max./Min./Avg. number of traversing connection routes</a>: It is equal to the maximum, minimum, and average number of active connection routes traversing the link at any time. The average value is a time-averaged metric</li>
